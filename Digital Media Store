## For this SQL project, I analyzed a dataset called "chinook," which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices and customers.
## Using this dataset in SQLiteStudio (3.3.3), I answered multiple questions using the following written SQL queries

## Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != 'USA';

## Show only the Customers from Brazil. 

SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

## Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country. */

SELECT cust.FirstName, 
cust.LastName, 
inv.InvoiceId, 
inv.InvoiceDate,
inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

## Show the Employees who are Sales Agents. 

SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

## Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table. 

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

## Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. 
The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name. 

SELECT 
emp.FirstName,
emp.LastName,
inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

## Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name 
for all invoices and customers. 

SELECT emp.LastName AS Emp_LastName, 
emp.Firstname AS Emp_FirstName, 
cust.LastName AS Cust_LastName, 
cust.FirstName AS Cust_FirstName, 
cust.Country, 
inv.total AS Inv_Total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

## How many Invoices were there in 2009? 

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

## What are the total sales for 2009? 

SELECT SUM(total) AS total_price
FROM chinook.invoices 
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

## Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line item. 

SELECT t.name, i.invoicelineid
FROM chinook.invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON i.trackid = t.trackid;

## Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name 
with each invoice line item. 

SELECT t.Name, t.Composer, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i 
JOIN chinook.Tracks t ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId;

## Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, 
and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre. 

SELECT t.name AS 'Track Name',

## Show the total sales made by each sales agent. 

SELECT e.FirstName,
e.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(i.total), 2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees e 
JOIN chinook.customers c ON c.supportrepid=e.employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices i ON i.customerid=c.customerid
WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'

## Which sales agent made the most in sales in 2009? 

SELECT

## Which countries reported the highest sales for the year 2010? 

SELECT billingcountry,
ROUND(SUM(total), 2) AS 'Total Sales',
COUNT(invoiceid) AS 'Total Orders'
FROM chinook.invoices

## Select the tracks that grossed the most sales per track for the year 2009 Include the artist name, and limit results to ten. 

SELECT
